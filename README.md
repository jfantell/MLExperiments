## Overview

This repo will serve as a collection of ML experiments/tutorials.

*The code in this repo has been tested on a machine running Ubuntu Linux 20.0.4 with Python 3.8 installed. VS Code's Jupyter notebook plugin was used to run the Jupyter notebooks*

## Prereqs

1. `sudo apt-get install swig`
